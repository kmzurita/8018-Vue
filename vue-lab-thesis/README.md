### Information
These lab has been modified so if you want to copy it you have to change a few things, and that will make you understand more about Vue

### Prerequisites

You need Node.js (v6.11.1), NPM and/or Yarn on your local machine. I strongly recommend usage of [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing different versions of Node on your local machine.

### Installing

This app uses Vue.js pre-made Webpack template as its base. So you have all commands that come with it and many more!

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3003
yarn start

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```
